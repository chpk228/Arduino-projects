1. Microcontroller - this is the brain of an Arduino, and is the component that we load programs into. Think of it as a tiny computer, designed to execute only a specific number of things.
2. USB port - used to connect your Arduino board to a computer.
3. USB to Serial chip - the USB to Serial is an important component, as it helps translating data that comes from e.g. a computer to the on-board microcontroller. This is what makes it possible to program the Arduino board from your computer.
4. Digital pins - pins that use digital logic (0,1 or LOW/HIGH). Commonly used for switches and to turn on/off an LED.
5. Analog pins - pins that can read analog values in a 10 bit resolution (0-1023).
6. 5V / 3.3V pins- these pins are used to power external components.
7. GND - also known as ground, negative or simply -, is used to complete a circuit, where the electrical level is at 0 volt.
8. VIN - stands for Voltage In, where you can connect external power supplies.
Depending on the Arduino board, you will find many more components. The items listed above are generally found on any Arduino board.
